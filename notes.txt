fetch on fake store
  --fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')

example:
  fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
  
  use context or either make it global state on app and pass it make one parent instead of homepage being the parent

  created card elements check

  make add to cart functional eg adding just a counter to cart indicator for now and u can adjust later with putting an item on the cart via api useeffect 
  and useState

  each card will probably need an individual useState for the amount we shall need map and keys after fetching the items 
  prob main goal first is adding the items show up in shop using card inside a Cards div that is grid
